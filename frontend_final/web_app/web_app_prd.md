3.2 Step 1: Input Documentation

Users can enter a URL pointing to their documentation.
The interface will include a text input field and a "Next" button.
Error handling for invalid URLs or inaccessible documentation.

3.3 Step 2: Generate and Test Chatbot

Display a loading indicator while processing the documentation.
Present a chat interface for users to interact with the generated chatbot.
Include a set of sample questions to help users start testing.
Provide a "Next" button to proceed to the final step.

3.4 Step 3: Get Embed Code

Display the embed code for the chatbot in a copyable text area.
Provide clear instructions on how to integrate the chatbot into a website.
Optional: Include a live preview of how the chatbot would appear on a sample webpage.

3.5 Navigation

Users should be able to move back to previous steps if needed.
Include a "Start Over" option to begin the process again.

4. Technical Requirements
4.1 Frontend

Framework: Next.js
Styling: Tailwind CSS
State Management: React Context API or Redux (if complexity increases)

4.2 Backend

API endpoints for each step of the process
Document processing and chatbot generation logic
Data storage for processed documentation and chatbot configurations

4.3 Deployment

Host on a platform compatible with Next.js (e.g., Vercel)
Ensure scalability to handle increasing numbers of users and chatbot interactions

5. Non-Functional Requirements
5.1 Performance

The application should load within 3 seconds on a standard broadband connection.
Chatbot responses should be generated within 2 seconds.

5.2 Security

Implement secure handling of user documentation and generated chatbots.
Use HTTPS for all connections.

5.3 Scalability

The system should be able to handle at least 1000 concurrent users.

6. Future Considerations
While not part of the initial MVP, the following features may be considered for future iterations:

User accounts and authentication
Dashboard for managing multiple chatbots
Advanced customization options for chatbot appearance and behavior
Analytics for chatbot usage and performance
