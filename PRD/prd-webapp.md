# One-Pager: Chat with Docs Web App

## Overview
We are building a web application that allows users to create, manage, and embed AI-powered chatbots that interact with their documentation. Users can paste documentation URLs, which the system will scrape, process, and use to generate a context-aware chatbot. The chatbot can then be managed and embedded into the user's website.

## Core Features

1. **Documentation Input**: 
   - Users can input multiple documentation URLs through the web interface.
   - Support for various documentation formats and structures.

2. **Chatbot Creation**:
   - Automatic scraping and processing of input documentation.
   - Generation of embeddings for efficient information retrieval.
   - Creation of a unique chatbot instance for each set of documentation.

3. **Chatbot Management Dashboard**:
   - Overview of all created chatbots with key metrics.
   - Ability to edit, update, or delete existing chatbots.
   - Options to update documentation sources for each chatbot.

4. **Customization Options**:
   - Customize chatbot appearance (colors, fonts, avatar).
   - Set welcome messages and default responses.
   - Configure chatbot behavior (e.g., response length, tone).

5. **Embedding and Integration**:
   - Generate embed codes for easy integration into websites.
   - Provide API endpoints for advanced integrations.

6. **Analytics and Insights**:
   - Track chatbot usage, popular questions, and user satisfaction.
   - Provide suggestions for improving chatbot performance.

7. **User Authentication and Management**:
   - Secure user accounts with authentication.
   - Manage API keys and usage limits.

## Architecture

### Frontend (React-based Web Application):
- User authentication and account management.
- Documentation URL input interface.
- Chatbot creation and management dashboard.
- Customization options for chatbots.
- Analytics and insights display.
- Embed code generation interface.

### Backend (FastAPI):
- User authentication and session management.
- Document scraping and processing module.
- Embedding generation and storage.
- Chatbot instance management.
- API endpoints for chatbot interactions and management.
- Analytics data collection and processing.

### Database:
- User account information.
- Chatbot configurations and settings.
- Processed documentation data.

### Vector Database:
- Storage of document embeddings for efficient retrieval.

### LLM Integration:
- Integration with OpenAI or other LLM providers for generating chatbot responses.

## User Flow
1. User signs up/logs in to the web app.
2. User navigates to "Create New Chatbot" page.
3. User inputs documentation URLs and chatbot name.
4. System processes documentation and creates chatbot instance.
5. User customizes chatbot appearance and behavior.
6. User obtains embed code or API details for integration.
7. User monitors chatbot performance through the dashboard.

## Future Enhancements
- Support for file uploads (PDFs, Word docs) in addition to URLs.
- Multi-language support for documentation and chatbot responses.
- Advanced AI training options for power users.
- Integration with popular CMS platforms (WordPress, Shopify, etc.).
- Collaborative features for team management of chatbots.

## Conclusion
This web application will provide a user-friendly interface for creating, managing, and deploying AI-powered chatbots based on documentation. It offers a complete solution from input to deployment, with customization and analytics features to ensure optimal performance and user satisfaction.
