## Overview
The embeddable "Chat with Docs" widget is a key component of our Chat with Docs web application. It allows users to integrate an AI-powered chatbot into their websites, enabling real-time interaction with their documentation. This widget is generated and managed through our web application, where users can customize its appearance and behavior.

## Core Features

1. **Easy Integration**:
   - Embed code generation for quick integration into any website.
   - Support for script tag and iframe embedding methods.

2. **Customizable Appearance**:
   - User-defined color schemes, fonts, and chat window size.
   - Option to set custom avatar and welcome messages.

3. **Real-time Documentation Interaction**:
   - Allows website visitors to ask questions about the embedded documentation.
   - Provides context-aware responses using LLM technology.

4. **Seamless Backend Connection**:
   - Connects to the user's instance on our web application backend.
   - Utilizes pre-processed documentation and embeddings for quick responses.

5. **Multi-document Support**:
   - Can reference multiple documentation sources as defined in the web app.

6. **Performance Optimized**:
   - Lightweight frontend to minimize impact on website load times.
   - Efficient API calls to backend for fast response times.

## Functional Requirements

### Frontend (React-based Widget):
- Responsive chat interface that adapts to different screen sizes.
- Real-time message display with typing indicators.
- Error handling and fallback messages for network issues.
- Optional feedback mechanism for users to rate responses.

### Backend Integration:
- Secure API calls to the Chat with Docs backend.
- Handling of authentication and rate limiting.
- Caching mechanisms for frequently asked questions.

### Customization:
- Dynamic application of user-defined styles and configurations.
- Ability to update widget settings without re-embedding.

## Architecture

### Widget Structure:
```
/chat-widget
├── /src
│   ├── /components
│   │   ├── ChatWindow.js
│   │   ├── MessageList.js
│   │   └── InputArea.js
│   ├── /services
│   │   └── api.js
│   ├── /styles
│   │   └── widget.css
│   └── index.js
├── package.json
└── webpack.config.js
```

### Integration Flow:
1. User configures chatbot in the Chat with Docs web application.
2. Web app generates unique embed code for the chatbot.
3. User adds embed code to their website.
4. Widget loads on user's website, connecting to Chat with Docs backend.
5. Website visitors interact with the widget, querying documentation.

## Usage Example
```html
<!-- Chat with Docs Widget Embed Code -->
<script src="https://chatwithdocs.com/widget.js" id="chatwithdocs-widget"
  data-chatbot-id="unique-chatbot-id">
</script>
```

## Security Considerations
- Use of secure HTTPS connections for all API calls.
- Implementation of CORS policies to restrict widget usage to approved domains.
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse of the service.

## Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading of widget resources to minimize initial page load impact.
- Use of WebSocket for real-time communication when appropriate.
- Efficient caching strategies for static assets and frequent queries.

## Analytics Integration
- Anonymous usage tracking to provide insights in the web application dashboard.
- Event tracking for key interactions (widget open, messages sent, etc.).

## Future Enhancements
- Offline mode support with service workers.
- Integration with popular CMS platforms for one-click installations.
- Advanced customization options (e.g., custom CSS injection).
- Multi-language support for international documentation.

## Conclusion
The embeddable "Chat with Docs" widget provides a seamless way for users to integrate AI-powered documentation assistance into their websites. Managed through our web application, it offers a balance of powerful features and ease of use, enhancing the documentation experience for end-users while providing valuable insights to documentation owners.
